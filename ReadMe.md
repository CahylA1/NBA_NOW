NBA NOW 

 With my project I created an application called "NBA NOW" that allows you to look up your favorite players currently in the NBA. If you ever wondered what team one of your favorite players got traded too or was just curious to know where your key role player was traded too .. you can use the NBA NOW app to find them . The App Displays the Players first and last name, their current team, their position and also the players height.
